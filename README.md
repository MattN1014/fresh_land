# fresh_land

Fresh Land is a fully responsive purple Bootstrap 4 landing page template. 

I have created two custom buttons to go with this theme they are:

btn-purple & btn-purple-outline.  

These buttons are used throughout the template, they can easily be changed by editing the custom.less file.  

If you wish to make changes to the template i would suggest doing so via the custom.less file.

Please feel free to use this theme, however please keep the templated create by part as it is (decrease the size if you wish) and also the link in place.  

Have fun with it. 

Please be aware that Bootstrap 4 is currently in Beta (at the time of writing this), so some features may change in the framework when it is made final.
